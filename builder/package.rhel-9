# Create post-install script required for OpenBLAS.
#
# On RHEL and SUSE, we link R against the internal shared BLAS to make the
# R binaries more portable and allow users to switch BLAS implementations without
# having to recompile R. We default to OpenBLAS, but users may prefer other implementations.
# 
# Binary packages built against the shared BLAS are also more portable and may be used
# with the default R distributed by RHEL/SUSE, or other R installations using
# shared BLAS and configured with a different BLAS (such as Microsoft R Open with MKL).
# This is especially important for RSPM's binary packages.
#
# On Ubuntu/Debian, we link R against the external BLAS instead (--with-blas/--with-lapack),
# as those distributions use the alternatives system to swap BLAS libraries at runtime.
# The default R distributions on Ubuntu/Debian use the external BLAS, so we do as well
# for portability.
